"""OAuth callback passthrough for agent-driven skill setup.

Hermes Agent ships with per-skill setup scripts (e.g.
``/opt/hermes/skills/productivity/google-workspace/scripts/setup.py``) that
are explicitly designed to be agent-driven — the agent runs ``--auth-url``
to get an OAuth consent link, sends it to the user, the user authorizes in
their browser, and the agent runs ``--auth-code <CODE>`` to finalise.

The problem with that flow on Dream Talk: the user has to manually copy
the OAuth code out of their browser's URL bar and paste it back into the
chat. That's the friction you feel on every setup. The "magic" UX is the
browser redirect coming back to a Dream Server endpoint that captures the
code and hands it to the agent automatically — that's this module.

How it slots in:

  1. Agent runs ``setup.py --auth-url`` (via its terminal_tool). The
     ``redirect_uri`` baked into the OAuth client points at this module's
     ``/api/oauth/callback`` route on the operator's Dream Server host.
  2. Agent sends the auth URL to the user as a markdown link. The user
     taps it, authorises in Google/Spotify/etc., and the provider
     redirects to ``/api/oauth/callback?code=...&state=<skill-id>``.
  3. This handler writes the ``{code, state, ts}`` payload to
     ``data/persona/oauth_callback.json`` (operator-owned, both Hermes
     and dashboard-api can read it) and returns a friendly success page
     the user sees in their browser.
  4. The agent (per persona) checks for the callback file after sending
     the URL — when present, it consumes the code, runs the skill's
     ``setup.py --auth-code <CODE>`` to finalise, deletes the file, and
     confirms to the user.

Why a file rather than calling Hermes directly: dashboard-api can't
docker-exec into the hermes container without docker-in-docker
plumbing, and the hermes container is uid-10000-owned so dashboard-api
can't write into ``/opt/data`` either. ``data/persona/`` is the
operator-owned shared mount (same one the install-context SOUL.md
lives in) that both containers can read.

Security:
  * No authentication on the callback route (it's a redirect target —
    we can't enforce session cookies from a provider redirect). Protection
    comes from the ``state`` parameter the agent passes through, which is
    a randomly-generated nonce stored alongside the pending request.
    The agent should reject any callback whose state doesn't match the
    one it issued.
  * Codes have very short TTLs at the provider (~10 min) so a leaked
    callback file isn't long-exploitable.
  * Codes are single-use — re-exchange attempts fail at the provider.
